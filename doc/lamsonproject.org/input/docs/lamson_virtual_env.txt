Title: Installing Lamson Into Virtualenv With Pip


The best way to install Lamson in a virtualenv is using the "pip
tool":http://pip.openplans.org/ to install it. This will automatically fetch
the code from bazaar, install it inside the virtualenv and fetch any missing
dependencies.

First, if you haven't already, you'll need to install pip. Make sure 
you've activated the virtualenv:

<pre class="code">
. bin/activate
</pre>

from the root of the virtualenv, and then run:

<pre class="code">
easy_install -U pip
</pre>

Then just do:

<pre class="code">
pip install lamson
</pre>

Remember though that if you do install it like this you'll need to 
manually update it by visiting Launchpad, finding the latest tarball 
URL and `pip install`ing it.
